# 🛒 Baraqah Departmental Store

A full-stack e-commerce web app for a departmental store, featuring secure login, admin management, category-wise product browsing, cart system, invoice generation, and theme support.

---

⚠️ Heads Up: The backend is hosted on Render's free tier, which goes to sleep after inactivity. So the first load may take ~30s. After that, it works smoothly.

I'm keeping it free right now, but open to hosting upgrades or feedback!
